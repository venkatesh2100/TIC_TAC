# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

This was my final project to conclude the CS50  Introduction to Programming with Python.

This is a full-stack Tic Tac Toe game that allows users to play either in single-player mode against an AI or in multiplayer mode against another player. The application utilizes Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, providing a seamless and interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Play against another player on the same device.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The board updates in real-time with each player's move.
- **Game Over Detection**: Detects and announces the winner or a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Used for building the backend server.
- **React**: Used for building the frontend user interface.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for styling and structuring the frontend components.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic on the frontend.

## Pictures

- **Game Board**: Displays the current state of the game.
- **Winner Announcement**: Shows a message when a player wins.
- **Draw Announcement**: Shows a message when the game is a draw.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts well to mobile devices.
